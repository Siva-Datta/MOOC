so next is your second example example two
right this one so i hope previous one you

might have under understood right ah and its
very simple thing this all these things are

right so a generating station has a maximum
demand of eighty megawatt and a connected

load of one fifty megawatt right if megawatt
hour that is energy generated in a year is

that is annual energy generation year is four
hundred into ten to the power three a megawatt

hour you have to compute load factor and demand
factor right so maximum demand is given eighty

megawatt right connected load also given one
fifty megawatt units generated in one year

is given four hundred into ten to the power
three megawatt hour it is given in megawatt

hour generated in a year is four hundred into
ten to the power three right and total number

of hours in a year is equal to t is equal
to eight seven six zero right so all data

are known right therefore average load you
can find that it is annual energy generated

divided by the total number of hours
so it is four hundred into ten to the power

three divided by t t is equal to eight seven
six zero is equal to forty five point six

six two megawatt right a load factor lf is
equal to average load by maximum load so average

load is forty five point six six two megawatt
and maximum is eighty so load factor is point

five seven right and demand factor df is equal
to maximum demand by connected load maximum

demand was eighty megawatt and connected load
one fifty megawatt therefore demand factor

is equal to point five three three right so
these are simple example but all these terminology

whatever we have used so we will take one
after another few example such that it will

be understandable to you next is example three
right so a sample distribution system is shown

in figure five figure five i will show you
later one of the feeders supplies an industrial

load with a peak of two megawatt and the other
supplies residential loads with a peak of

two megawatt combined peak demand is three
megawatt determine a the diversity factor

of the load connected to transformer b the
load diversity of the load connected to transformer

and c the coincidence factor of the load connected
to transformer

so these three things you have to obtain now
figure five for this example right so it is

it is given this sub transmission system transformer
is there this is this is distribution ah substation

and this is industrial load residential load
and these are for future loads this is a diagram

samples ah distribution system of example
three right now from equation seven diversity

factor is that from equation seven that diversity
factor formula is fd is equal to sigma i is

equal to one to n pi upon pc but here you
have a two consumers right ah your here it

is given one for industrial another for your
residential right industrial and residential

so n is equal to two so i is equal to one
to two pi that is by pc that is p one plus

p two upon pc right so it is given for both
the cases industrialism industrial load with

a peak of two megawatt and other supplier
residential load with a peak of two megawatt

that means p one is equal to two p two is
equal to two that is two plus two and total

and combined peak demand is three megawatt
so pc is equal to three megawatt right so

two plus two by three so it is one point three
three three right so this is your diversity

factor
now from equation fourteen from equation fourteen

that load diversity ld is equal to sigma i
is equal to one to n pi minus pc n is equal

to two p one is equal to p two is equal to
two megawatt and pc is equal to three megawatt

right therefore load diversity is equal to
p one plus p two minus pc that is two plus

two minus three megawatt a load diversity
is one megawatt and from equation thirteen

coincidence factor is cf is equal to one upon
diversity factor right is equal to one upon

one point three three three is equal to point
seven five right

so this numerical this problems are very you
know very simple very simple right next stage

we will try to establish a relationship between
load factor or and the loss factor also direct

is not possible but we will try to establish
some relationship so relationship between

load factor and loss factor right first before
coming to this in general loss factor cannot

be determined from the load factor right so
generally generally it is directly it is not

possible however the limiting values of the
relationship can be established right so figures

this is figure six it shows an arbitrary and
idealized load curve and it does not represent

a daily load curve this is just to establish
a relationship something has been drawn so

if you tik take this y axis first take the
load say this is peak load for a this thing

is p two and off peak load is p one and its
average is this dash line is the average load

right something something we have drawn
so this peak load that your the duration is

from zero to small t timing right and off
peak load from your t to t the duration will

be capital t minus small t right so this is
peak load p two and off peak load is p one

average is p average this is the load curve
this is something has been drawn it is the

it is the idea ideal ah load curve right something
has been taken corresponding this two a that

peak load for the system suppose loss is peak
loss is l two responding this peak load the

loss is your peak loss this loss also peak
loss also will exist from zero to t only because

peak load is zero to t right and then here
your your off peak off peak due to for off

peak load p one the loss is l one right this
is that this is that off peak load l one right

and then this duration is from small t to
capital t that means t minus t right and this

is also i know i know

this dash line blue dash line is the average
loss so this kind of a just to establish the

we will try to establish relationship between
that your load factor lf and the last factor

llf right but this is nothing it is not reality
but for the sake of your you know for the

sake of establishing a relationship we have
make it may you are made it like this right

if we do so then assume that the peak load
p two so the i told you peak load is p two

this p two and corresponding loss is peak
loss is l two i told you and ah and at off

peak load p one loss is l one off peak load
is p one and corresponding loss is l one right

and the load factor is lf is equal to p average
upon p max here we have taken that this is

some average load line so this is my p average
divided by peak p max p max is nothing but

the p two right so this is equation twenty
three now from figure six i mean this figure

from this figure if you see like this ah that
from figure six if you see that your p average

is equal to p two it duration is t so p two
into t small t small t plus that duration

of p one is this is now low load level p one
duration is capital t minus small t so plus

p one into capital t minus small t divided
by total duration zero to t that is that is

your divided by t right
so that is your p average therefore from equation

twenty three and twenty four we obtain that
is your load factor is equal to this p average

this p average you substitute here right if
you subs if you substitute here then load

factor is equal to p two into t plus p one
into capital t minus small t divided by p

two into capital t right i hope this part
is understandable to all of you right next

that means this one this one this load factor
lf is equal to i am rewriting once again p

two plus p one into t minus capital t divided
by p two into t that means this one it can

be written as p two into t divided by p two
into capital t plus p one into t minus t divided

by p two into t this way you can write therefore
l f is equal to p two p two will be canceled

so t by t plus it will be p one upon p two
into t minus t by t right that means ah this

lf this lf

so here we are writing this l f is equal to
therefore whatever i wrote that t by small

t by capital t plus one upon p two into t
minus t upon t this is equation twenty five

right similarly the loss factor is double
llf right llf is equal to l average upon l

max right so from this ah from third figure
it is your this this line is l average l average

upon l two right l two is the peak loss that
means during peak load this is the peak loss

l two right so that means l max is equal to
l two this is equation twenty six l max is

equal to maximum power loss is equal to l
two and l average is equal to average power

loss from figure six similarly you will obtain
same thing that peak loss is existing from

zero to t so l two into t plus your l one
is l one is that the your off peak power loss

so it is l one into t minus t divided by the
your t right so that is your l average total

duration is t so that is your equation twenty
seven similarly this loss also you can write

so this l average this l average you substitute
here you substitute this l average expression

in twenty six here here you substitute if
you substitute here then you will see thats

why i am writing from equation twenty six
and twenty seven we get lf is equal to l two

into t plus l one into t minus t divided by
l two into t same as before

so this is twenty eight right now small t
is the peak load duration and capital t minus

small t is equal to off [vocalized noise]
off peak load duration now the copper losses

are the function of associate load we know
that your power loss is in general i square

r loss right and i means the current and hence
that current is depend on the load only right

are are the function of the associate loads
therefore the loss at off peak and peak load

can be expressed as at off peak hours loss
is l one is equal to some constant into p

one square because as because loss actually
is proportional to the square of the load

i mean approximately proportional to the square
of the load load have different characteristic

but for the establishing this relationship
the loss is so off peak hours off peak hours

load is p one and loss is l one this this
k is the constant of proportionality it will

remain same for both right

so l one is equal to k into p one square similarly
at peak hours loss l two is equal to k into

p two square right this this is quite valid
this is quite true because loss is proportional

to i square and i depends current depends
on the load hence the loss also to some extent

relate to the square of the load right therefore
this l one this l one is equal to k into p

one square right and l two is equal to k into
p two square you substitute in equation twenty

eight this l one and l two expression you
substitute here in equation twenty eight if

you do so therefore you are writing from equation
twenty eight twenty nine and thirty therefore

from equation twenty eight twenty nine and
thirty we get lf is after simplification lf

is equal to small t by capital t plus p one
upon p two whole square into t minus capital

t minus small t divided by capital t this
is equation thirty one you substitute and

just simplify same as before right therefore
loss factor is expression is this one right

no by equi by using equation twenty five and
thirty one let that means this equation that

means using this equation this is the load
factor your equation and this is the loss

factors equation using this two equation we
will try to establish a relationship between

load factor and your loss factor right so
how to how to make it so for three different

cases we will consider from that we will try
to establish some relationship case one off

peak load is zero that means there is no off
peak load that means if no off peak load then

p one is zero that means your l one is also
zero loss off peak load p one zero means at

off peak load zero means off peak loss is
also zero therefore from equation twenty five

and thirty one so equation twenty five is
this one so here you put p one is equal to

zero and your what you call l one your if
you put p one is equal to zero

in this expression then what will happen that
a your lf will become if you put here let

me write down if it is take this take this
equation twenty five for the case one is off

peak load is zero that means this case one
off peak load is zero that means if p one

is equal to zero and then l one is then l
one is also zero therefore your equation your

twenty five equation twenty five here it is
lf is equal to t by t plus p one by p two

into t minus t by capital t but here pone
is zero that means l f is equal to small t

by capital t right similarly in equation thirty
one equation thirty one is this one this is

for lf equation thirty one this expression
is there loss factor is equal to small t by

capital t plus p one by p two whole square
into t minus t by capital t but p one is zero

if you put p one zero this term will not be
there therefore loss factor also is equal

to t by t right this one here also this one
that means for the case of for where off peak

load is zero that means load factor is equal
to loss factor thats why here we are writing

that if off peak load is zero then therefore
equation from equation twenty five will get

that lf is equal to this is from equation
twenty five lf is equal to small t by capital

t and from thirty one also we get a itthis
llf is equal to t by t therefore this thing

and this thing they are same lf llf lf is
equal to llf therefore this we have lf is

equal to llf is equal to it is your ah t by
t small t by capital t write therefore it

is your equation thirty two that is load factor
is equal to the loss factor and they are equal

to small t by capital t is equal to constant

this is for the case one this case one we
have assumed right because we have to establish

some relationship thats why you have assumed
right similarly now case two very short lasting

peak right in this case the time t tends to
zero therefore equation if you look at equation

twenty five just hold on equation twenty five
equation twenty five when t minus your ah

t ah ah very short lasting peak that means
here t tends to zero hence in equation twenty

five that t minus t divided by t tends to
one therefore we can make it loss factor is

equal to this thing from equation twenty five
and thirty one come to this ah thirty one

where is equation thirty one this one right
when t tends to t tends to zero right ah where

it has gone yes yes ah when t minus t upon
t your ah distance to one right and llf is

equal to your here t tends to zero so from
this two condition from this two condition

you will get that loss factor is equal to
load factor square you take t tends to zero

and equation twenty five and thirty one if
t tends to zero means t minus t upon t tends

to your what you call ah your one right and
in the end in the twenty and in that equation

your ah load factor equation when just hold
on ill make it here such that the things will

be easier for you right first you consider
twenty five right and the condition is that

your ah case two that very short lasting peak
that means t tends to first you come t tends

to zero right that means t minus t by capital
t it tends to one point zero because t tends

to zero then this term tends to one therefore
equation twenty five you take equation twenty

five it is load factor is equal to t by t
plus p one by p two into t minus t by t as

t tends to zero

this is this this terminology tends to one
and this is zero that means lf equal to p

one by p two this is your load factor for
this condition similarly if you look at equation

twenty five right not twenty five thirty one
that loss factor expression that loss factor

expression is i am writing here llf this is
equation thirty one it is t by t plus p one

by p two right whole square then t minus t
by capital t as t tends to zero and this t

minus small t upon capital t tends to one
that means llf is equal to your p one by p

two square this term will vanish and this
tends to one it will p one p two whole square

right and your lf lf is equal to p one upon
p two that means this one is equal to load

factor square that means loss factor for this
condition is equal to square of the load factor

therefore we are writing this one that here
t tends to zero therefore from equation twenty

five and thirty one loss loss factor is equal
to load factor square this is equation thirty

three another condition is while load is steady
that is here t tends to t constant load is

steady t tends to t that is the difference
between peak and off leak load is negligible

almost constant in that case you will get
same thing from equation twenty five you will

get loss factor is equal to load factor right

so that means your small t is tends to your
capital t right therefore load is steady in

that case you will get it ah that loss factor
is equal to load factor that means one condition

we we got three different condit[ion]- conditions
but therefore in general the it is coming

like this first condition whatever we saw
that loss factor is equal to load factor then

another condition you took it is your equal
to lf square so generally load factor is less

than ah less than one so ah so and therefore
loss factor will be greater than lf square

square of the load factor but less than your
load factors so greater than square of the

your lf square and less than lf so this is
this is the ah that ah this is that your what

you call the condition for the loss factors
something can be established but in general

it has been observed that the loss factor
cannot be determined directly from the load

factor it is not possible right however and
approximate formula to relate the loss factor

to the load factor as that loss factor is
equal to point three into load factor plus

point seven into your load factors square
this this equation or this terminology is

used by many particularly for the you know
ah for the city areas or ah this thing ah

this formula is quite quite valid but if it
is a rural rural areas right rural feeder

or this thing in that case instead of point
three it comes point two into lf plus point

eight

lf square right so and approximately it has
been found that this this equation what relates

ol between loss factor and the load factor
right so this is the relationship between

loss factor and the load factor these are
all these general thing i am telling in the

at the beginning right after that we will
see something different but you one should

be familiar with all sort of terminology loss
factor load factor everything but for rural

feeder rural load if this instead of point
three it is point two they take and it is

point eight some other relationships also
comes because loss factor or load factor depends

on the load growth also which i will not tell
anything yet but it depends on the load growth

also right next is your load growth actually
whenever you see any anyany sort of thing

load is increasing right continuously right
so some cases some places maybe it is at a

rate of three percent four percent five percent
annually or even more so load growth is always

there so if load inc load increases so general
your load increases means demand is increasing

right and demand increases means suppose in
a particular network load demand is increasing

means that you need to supply the need to
supply that load

so in that case if load increases you have
to think many thing because power loss will

increase then every every year load is increasing
that means voltage will also at different

point will go down right all these things
you need to maintain at a appropriate level

so load growth is the most important factor
that is inevitable that load will increase

right influencing the expansion of distribution
system forecasting of load increases is essential

to the planning period so one has to forecast
the load that how things will happen i am

what i am telling you here just the preliminary
thing or basic thing right but load growth

is the important part of our power system
right so if the if the if the load growth

rate is known right then load at the end of
the m th year is given by so suppose pm is

equal to p zero one plus g to the power m
this is eqaution thirty seven where pm is

the load at the end of mth year suppose today
at this point it is the base year that is

initial load right
so suppose suppose this two thousand seventeen

at this point load is p zero next year at
this time it will be ah it is suppose it is

increasing at a rate of say five percent so
g is the annual load growth rate say g is

the five percent and it is number of years
that means pm is the load at the end of the

m th year p zero initial load load at the
base year g is the annual load growth rate

and m is the number of years for example ah
for example suppose suppose your pm we are

writing that p zero one plus g to the power
m right p zero is the load at the you know

or this thing base year that means at this
suppose this year right and g is the annual

your load growth rate so suppose g is equal
to five percent that is zero point zero five

right therefore your pm is equal to it can
be written as p zero one plus zero point zero

five to the power m that means pm is equal
to p zero one point zero five to the power

m right when base year when m is equal to
zero pm is equal to p zero say its automatic

now when m is equal to one pm is equal to
p zero into one point zero five when m is

equal to two pm is equal to p zero into one
point zero five square and so on

similarly for m is equal to three pm is equal
to sorry i can put pm m is equal to one p

one after first year when m is equal to two
after that p two is equal to this one similarly

when m is equal to three p three is equal
to your p zero one point zero five cube right

suppose p zero if you take say hundred kilowatt
for example right so first year load will

be hundred kilowatt next year it will be hundred
into one point zero five right hundred five

now second year it will be hundred into one
point zero five square third year it will

be hundred into one point zero five cube and

so on this is that load growth rate ah formula
right that pm is equal to p zero one plus

g to the power m right next actually take
another example a another example a substation

it supplies power to four feeders right feeder
a has six consumers whose individual daily

maximum demands are seventy kilowatt ninety
kilowatt twenty kilowatt fifty kilowatt ten

kilowatt and twenty kilowatt right while maximum
demand on the feeder is two hundred kilowatt

similarly for feeder b it supplies four consumers
whose daily maximum demand are 

sixty kilowatt forty kilowatt seventy kilowatt
and thirty kilowatt right while maximum demand

on feeder b is one sixty kilowatt right feeder
c and d have a daily maximum demand of o e

fifty kilowatt and two hundred kilowatt respectively
while the maximum demand on the station is

six hundred kilowatt right so in this case
you have to find out right dive diversity

factor i didnt write here that what you have
to obtain you have to find out diversity factor

for feeder a and feeder b
so from equation six diversity factor is fd

is equal to sum of individual maximum demands
divided by coincident maximum demand for feeder

a coincident maximum demands is given two
hundred kilowatt it is given right and therefore

so sum up individual maximum demand so six
are there seventy ninety twenty fifty ten

and twenty watt they are all kilowatts divided
by coincident maximum demand two hundred kilowatt

so for feeder a diversity factor is one point
three similarly for feeder b four consumers

are there sixty plus forty plus seventy plus
thirty all are in kilowatt and their peak

is one sixty
therefore diversity factor for this one is

one point two five right so next one is for
feeder b then diversity factor of the four

feeders fd is equal then add two hundred plus
one sixty plus one fifty plus two hundred

divided by sixty it comes about one point
one eight three the diversity factor of the

four feeders right feeder a feeder b and for
the four feeders so for feeder b one point

two five and for the four feeders other two
feeders data are given feeders c and d they

were daily maximum one fifty and two hundred
here we have made other two are two hundred

and one sixty and maximum demand of the station
is six hundred kilowatt so diversity factor

of the all four feeders will be two hundred
plus one sixty plus one fifty plus two hundred

that is one point one eight three
