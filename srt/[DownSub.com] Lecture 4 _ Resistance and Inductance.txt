so next is disadvantages of low power factor
right so what are the disadvantages for a

three phase balance system for example say
if load is pl say some terminal voltage is

v and power factor is cos phi then load current
is given by il is equal to pl upon root three

v cos phi this is equation thirty five now
if pl and v if both are constants say then

the load current il is inversely proportional
to the power factor if pl and v both are constants

that is phi constant cos phi is constant if
then if cos phi is low then il is large if

pl v constant then cos phi is low so il will
be large the poor power factor of the system

has the following disadvantages so this is
a for first couple of hours this is for your

some general ideas of the system or power
factor now number one the rating of generators

and transformers are inversely proportional
to the power thus generators and the ran transformers

are required to deliver same load that is
real power at low power factor if power factor

is poor hence system kva or mva supply will
increase right because if power factor is

poor although to supply the same real power
that kva or mva supply will increase because

reactive power will increase right

now bec hence many many other things are associated
with that later we will discuss at low power

factor the transmission lines feeders or cable
have to carry more current for the same power

to be transmitted because because because
of poor power factor more ah your what you

call reactive power has to flow through the
line right so this thus conductor size will

increase because current will increase right
therefore ampacity of the conductor will increase

conductor size will increase if current density
in the line is to be kept constant right therefore

ah at low power factor the transmission lines
feeder or cable will have to carry more current

for the same power to be transmitted thus
conductor size will increase if current density

in the line to be kept constant right therefore
more copper is required to for transmission

lines feeders and cables to deliver the same
load but at low power factor then we get low

power factor current will be high right therefore
the conductor size will increase right therefore

this if conductor size increases is you did
ah if you you did more volume of the copper

will be required right so that way it is that
way it is ah i will explain right if it is

now conductors are are conductor right all
these things are there but volume of the conductor

will increase right for to for the same load
to be transmitted therefore power factor is

an poor power factor has lot of disadvantages
right number three is power loss is proportional

to the square of the current and hence inversely
proportional to the square of the power factor

so more power losses incur at low power factor
and hence poor efficiency that means transmission

line efficiency will be poor because line
current will increase and therefore power

loss will increase right so this is number
three and number four is low lagging power

factor result in large voltage drop right
which result in poor voltage regulation hence

additional regulating equipment is required
to keep the voltage drop within permissible

limit right so all these are the disadvantages
of poor power factor we always want that for

any system it should operate at unity power
factor perhaps reality it may not be possible

but we want that right so electric utilities
insist the industrial consumer particularly

industrial consumers to maintain the power
factor zero point eight or above right bec

industry they have different parts of tariff
right sometimes they charge they charge on

kilowatt rate he got kilowatt demand kva demand
they have two part or three part tariff right

if your power factor is poor then kva demand
will be more then more tariff based on kva

demand also they charge utilities they charge
from the industry on kva demand thats why

they have to improve the power factor right
so the power tariffs are devised to penalize

the consumers with low lagging power factor
and force them to install power factor correct

correction devices for example some capacitor
that if your power factor is poor

you will take you will draw more kva from
the utility right and in this case you have

to pay more money because they they have a
two part tariff the charge on your maximum

kva demand also if your kva demand is less
if kva demand is less means power factor is

better right or kva demand is more means power
factor is poor so thats why they will always

try to see that kva demand is less because
they one part of that tariff is based on their

kilo volt ampere or kva demand right now various
causes of low power factor most of the induction

motors operate at lagging power factor right
the power factor of these motors falls with

the decrease of load this is one reason then
second one is occurrence of increase supply

main voltage during low load period right
the magnetizing current of inductive reactance

increase and power ah of the electrical plant
as a whole comes down right ah it is it is

actually power factor right third one is very
low lagging power factor of agriculture motor

pumpset agricultural motor pumpset they operate
at very low power factor right i mean very

poor and because of that also sometimes agricultural
motor pump sets also you will find that frequent

working of the winding fault will be there
right then arc lamps electric discharge lamps

and some other electric equipments operate
at very low power factor right arc and induction

furnaces operate on very low lagging power
factor

so these are some of the equipment they operate
at very low lagging power factor right these

are some of the so ah your what you call the
they are common a common reason for low various

cases for low power factor right next will
take another example right a peak demand of

a generating station is ninety megawatt and
load factor is point six the plant capacity

factor and plant use factor are point five
and point eight respectively this plant capacity

factor and plant use factor earlier we have
discussed right determine daily energy produced

b installed capacity of plant right and and
c that reserve capacity of plant and d utilization

factor this four things we have to obtain
daily energy produced then installed capacity

of plant then reserve capacity of plant and
d utilization factor right so solution maximum

demand is ninety megawatt this is given maximum
demand is given ninety megawatt right and

your load factor is given point six that is
also given therefore average demand is equal

to maximum demand into load factor so average
demand is ninety into point six hence fifty

four megawatt this is the average demand now
daily daily energy produced is equal to average

demand into twenty four hours in a day

so twenty four that is fifty four into twenty
four it is equal to one two nine six megawatt

hour right so from equation three now plant
factor is equal to this part b but b we have

to find out installed capacity of plant now
plant factor is equal to annual energy produced

right divided by maximum plant rating into
the time plant factor is given point five

it is given right and actual energy produced
already you have got it one two nine six megawatt

hour this also you have got it therefore therefore
maximum plant rating it is one two nine six

right divided by point five into twenty four
is equal to hundred eight megawatt this is

the plant rating therefore plant rating is
equal to installed capacity so installed capacity

is hundred eight megawatt right now part c
reserve capacity is equal to installed capacity

minus peak demand installed capacity is hundred
eight megawatt and peak demand is ninety megawatt

that is already given peak demand is given
ninety megawatt right therefore hundred eight

minus ninety that is eighteen megawatt right
and from equation two utilization factor right

uf is equal to maximum demand of the system
divided by rated system capacity maximum demand

is ninety megawatt and this is rated system
capacity it is installed capacity that is

that is the same thing that is the rated system
capacity hundred eight megawatt so utilization

factor is ninety divided by hundred eight
that is is equal to point eight three three

right right so this is the general so some
examples some four five examples ah standard

examples we have taken for these you know
that introduction part all together structure

of power systems and few other aspects right
so from this sums we have we have we have

some general ideas regarding the different
terminology regarding transmission generation

transmission and distribution systems right
plus we have seen that relationship between

load factor and loss factor that how direct
it is not possible but some relationships

has been established and those formula for
relationship between loss factor and load

factor are commonly used right and some general
ideas you have regarding different type of

load factor loss factor utilization factor
coincidence factor then demand factor then

diversity factor all this terminology ah in
the beginning we have used right and after

this we will ah we will ah start for this
thing is that that your what you call that

ah resistance inductance capacitance of the
transmission line

first we will see that resistance then we
will see that your what you call ah ah inductance

and then will see the capacitance of the this
thing transmission line right so these are

the common thing for this ah power system
course and so first thing is that will start

from the this thing that resistance and inductance
of transmission lines after that we will see

that your what you call that capacitance so
basic purpose of a transmission network is

to transfer electrical energy that we have
seen these thing we have we have the previous

thing from generating units at various locations
right to that distribution systems which ultimately

supplies the load so transmission system actually
transmits power from the generating to the

consumer distribution side right so transmission
line also interconnect neighboring power utilities

just we have discussed before right which
allows not only economic dispatch of electrical

power within regions during normal conditions
but also transfer of power between regions

during emergencies right so this is that interconnected
operations we have seen before that how actually

different areas are interconnected how it
will be useful that reasons for interconnections

right basically a transmission line has four
parameters resistance inductance capacitance

and shunt conductance these four parameters
are there for transmission system a transmission

line so generally ah your resistance is a
important part of a transmission line ah because

it consumes a copper loss i square r right
it that is the major thing

so resistance here are important and for transmission
system that ah different for different your

what you call different voltage levels the
different type of conductors are used particularly

for transmission system ah i if i can recall
all sort of thing that you will find the conductors

names name of the animals like zebra then
tiger right then your wolf that different

name of the different animals right those
conductors and it depends on the voltage levels

different conductors has ah different resistance
per ohm per kilometer and as well as that

reactance right so while of course it has
a it bundled conductors are there double circuit

lines are there different type of ah when
you have seen that high tension transmission

line we have seen in each face you may have
two or three or even more conductors bundle

conductors are there sometime single conductors
are there in each phase right so all these

all these things ah your this resistance depends
on the your of course it depends on the type

of the ah material whatever used for the conductor
and its cross sectional area because we know

r is equal to resistance is equal to rho into
upon a is the cross sectional area of the

conductor

so this when if i if i recall correctly the
resistance of course it depends on the cross

sectional area if you have a if you have a
very you know large if the cross section of

the conductor is large right then r is equal
to rho l by a so later the resistance will

be lower right but in the case of reactance
resistance vary ah in a very you know in a

thirty three kv to four hundred kv transmission
lines resistance are different they are totally

different i mean quite lower value to higher
higher value to lower lower value from low

voltage to high voltage where is in the case
of inductance and and hence the reactance

ah whenever we try to compute i was making
some computation i found that reactance ah

part generally ah v with voltage level from
thirty three kv to ah say four hundred kv

reactant it will find varies in between point
two six point two six ohm per kilometer to

point three four or point three five ohm per
kilometer right this way more or less it varies

right for a resistance where resistance various
is much more for ah your your transmission

ah line right

so later will try to see so this ah this ah
shunt this shunt conductance actually we have

told three parameters for resistance ah inductance
capacitance and shunt conductance so shunt

conductance actually accounts for leakage
current flowing across the insulators and

ionized path wise in the air right so but
this leakage currents are negligible this

leakage currents are negligible as compared
to the current flowing in the transmission

lines so this shunt conductance conductance
theme will not considered for this our study

right but for the sake of you know clarification
basically for transmission line we consider

four parameters so resistance inductance capacitance
and your conductance right so it is for across

the insulator it may happen and ionized path
wise in the year right but the series resistance

cause a causes a real power loss in the conductor
because i square loss r loss will be there

so resistance of the conductor is very important
in transmission efficiency evaluation and

economic studies because if resistance is
more then power loss will be more right so

this will be this is very important second
thing is the power transmission capacity of

the transmission line is mainly governed by
the series inductance ax right for a transmission

line if you see that r by x ratio is quite
small or other x by r ratio is quite high

right therefore this your power transmission
capacity of the transmission line is mainly

governed by the series inductance right and
third point is the shunt capacitance causes

charging current to flow in the line right
and assumes importance for medium and long

transmission line long overhead lines if it
is a cable then perhaps at low voltage level

leven eleven kv also you have to consider
the charging current you cannot ignore right

but for overhead transmission line this charging
a your shunt capacitance upto thirty three

kv level you may ignore but sixty six even
thirty three kv people are considering it

but if it is thirt sixty six kv or above you
have to consider the your shunt capacitance

but if the distribution side at eleven kv
site there is no need to consider the for

overhead distribution overhead eleven kv distribution
system there is no need to consider the your

charging capacitance or shunt capacitance
right but for cable you have to consider even

it is eleven kv also you have to consider
because their charging capacitance is quite

i mean it has a significant value right you
cannot you cannot ignore that right so so

these parameters are uniformly distributed
throughout but can be lumped for the purpose

of analysis an approximate basis actually
transmission line you have seen these parameters

are uniformly distributed right but for our
understanding and

for our analysis will consider they can be
lumped for the purpose of analysis an approximate

basis so this way we will analyse for example
let us start from the line resistance right

so generally the dc resistance of a solid
round conductor is given by we put r dc is

equal to rho into l upon a this is equation
one because this is a second topic so this

is again equation one right rho is equal to
resistivity of the conductor l is equal to

length of the conductor and a is equal to
cross sectional area of the conductor right

so the conductor resistance is affected by
three factors one is the frequency second

is the spiralling and third is the temperature
this three factors basically affects the conductor

resistance and this is basically a dc resistance
r dc is equal to rho into l by a right 

so the dc resistance of a standard conductor
is greater than the value given by equation

one because spiralling of the actually a actually
if you look at the if you look at that the

transmission conductors they are actually
your spiralling of the strands make them longer

than the conductor itself it is not a solid
round conductor it is conductor if it is stranded

stranded conductor right and because of spiralling
that actual length is slightly or longer than

the conductor itself right this ink the increase
in resistance due to spiralling is around

one percent for three strand conductors and
about two percent for concentrically stranded

conductors

so little bit higher but one percent two percent
is ah not that very high but you have to consider

you have to consider now when an alternating
current flows through a conductor the current

distribution is actually not uniform right
for dc current the current distribution is

uniform right over the conductor cross sectional
area and the degree of non uniformity increases

with increase in frequency actually if it
is a dc current no there it suppose current

is suppose cross-sectional area is say five
centimeters square for a cond a very large

of course five centimeter square and say five
ampere current is flowing so current density

will be five five five one ampere per centimeter
square and it is uniform for dc current right

but when alternating current or ac current
flows right through a conductor the current

distribution is not uniform right over the
conductor cross sectional area and the degree

of non uniformity increases right with increase
in frequency and this will see later on when

you will study this inductance right the current
density is greatest at the surface of the

conductor this causes the ac resistance to
somewhat higher than the dc resistance right

and this effect is called as skin effect when
you will study inductance at that time will

see what is skin effect right that means at
every every point i of that cross section

the current density is not uniform for your
ah these thing when ah for a alternating current

right current density is different
so that means this source that ac resistance

is higher than the dc resistance right so
this effect actually is known as skin effect

so the conductor resistance increases with
the increase of the temperature if you know

that if temperature varies then conductor
resistance also will increase right for small

changes in temperature right the resistance
increases linearly as temperature increases

if temperature changes is small the resistance
will also if the this thing increase your

what you call linearly so and the resistance
that of temperature t is given by you know

this rt is equal to r zero one plus alpha
zero into t this is equation two where rt

is equal to resistance at t degree celsius
these are all basic thing right and r zero

is equal to resistance at zero degree celsius
and alpha zero is the temperature coefficient

of resistance at zero degree celsius so by
equation two by using equation two the resistance

are two at a temperature t two degree celsius
can be found if the resistance r one at a

temperature t one degree celsius is known
that is that r two upon r one right is equal

to t two plus one upon alpha zero divided
by t one plus one upon alpha zero then see

if you know if you if you know the resistance
r two at temperature a t two degree centigrade

can be found if the resistance r two r two
can be found at t or temperature t two

if the resistance r one at temperature t one
if it is if it is known to you so what will

do from this relation we will write one equation
r two is equal to r zero plus one plus ah

alpha zero you are t two another one will
write r one is equal to r zero one plus alpha

zero t one and then you will get r two upon
r one is equal to t two plus one upon alpha

zero upon t one plus one upon alpha zero right
now this is the this is that your ah what

you call this is the resistance and will although
will study everything slowly and slowly and

i believe that ah many of you have studied
these inductance capacitance so all these

things right so ah during this time apart
from of course next will come inductance after

that capacitance and after that that medium
line long line short line but before that

i am giving one exercise to all of you and
you try to do these for example for example

this is an exercise for you right this is
an exercise for you suppose you have all these

things will study but in advance i am giving
suppose you have a transmission line this

side is sending end this voltage is say v
one angle delta one this side is receiving

end is sending end voltage v two delta two
right this importance of the line is r plus

jx current flowing through this line is i
and here you have load p plus jq this is the

load right

now i am not writing anything my recorded
voice you can make out right now my objective

is i want to maintain this v one and v two
this is voltage magnitude v two voltage magnitude

i want to maintain my v one must be equal
to v one must be equal to v two i want to

maintain that for which i have to connect
a shunt capacitor here which is injecting

that say qc i put j qc which injecting a your
what you call a reactive power here right

to find to maintain voltage initially when
p when it was not there v two was say v two

was less than v one it is a lagging load so
v two was less than v one current is flowing

in this direction now as soon as i put some
value qc here i want through this i want to

maintain v one is equal to v two then then
i want to find out qc in terms of i made function

of in terms of v one v two p and q delta has
to eliminated there should not be any delta

in mathematical expression i want to find
out qc must be function of v one v two p and

q right ah only given hint is that your ah
qc when you will try to find out it will be

quadratic equation of qc there will be two
solutions for qc one is feasible and other

is not feasible but both the solution will
be function of v one v two p and q but one

is feasible other is not feasible right so
this exercise

i am giving you and those will take this course
ah this is an exercise if you can do this

of your own i will i will solve it but before
that before those video lecture when you will

see before that if anybody can do it and can
show this to me then i will appreciate that

right so this a very interesting problem so
