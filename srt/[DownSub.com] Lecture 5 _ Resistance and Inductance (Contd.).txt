so now ah we will go for the inductance of
transmission line ah the basic concepts right

so we know that a conductor when carrying
current has a magnetic field around a it right

for example suppose if we apply right hand
rule suppose if this is your co is if this

is your conductor right and if you have the
conductor in the like this then if this is

the direction of the current flow then this
is that anti clock if you see that anticlockwise

this is the direction of right so so whenever
a conductor carrying current it has a magnetic

field around it right so the magnetic lines
of force are concentric ah circles right having

their say having their centres at the centre
of the conductor if this is the conductor

if this is the conductor then they are they
are concentric circles right and there centre

at the centre of the conductors if i rapid
like this and if this is the direction of

the current the term the upwards then you
have the magnetic field right but they are

concentric circles actually and there centre
will be at the centre of the conductor right

so the voltage ah in that conductor right
induced in the conductor can be written as

e is equal to their your d psi by d t volt
right everywhere wherever possible i have

written the units right so it is e is equal
to d psi by d t volt this is actually equation

number four right where psi represent the
flux linkages of the conductor in weber tones

this is weber tones right so this equation
four it can be written in this form right

in this form it can be written so it is e
is equal to d psi by d t it would make it

like this e is equal to d psi upon of d i
into d i upon d t is equal to you write down

l into d i upon d t this is equation five
where l is equal to d psi by d i all right

so that means l it actually is a constant
of proportionality it is basically inductance

right so for a for a linear when l is equal
to d psi l is equal to d psi by d i is the

inductance in henrys
in a linear magnetic circuit right flux linkages

vary linearly with the current right such
that the inductance always remain constant

right so if the magnetic circuit is linear
then instead of a and and flux linkages vary

linearly with the current therefore inductance
always we will remain constant that means

this l is equal to d psi by d i we can write
l is equal to psi by i in henry right so as

it is linear magnetic circuit so we can write
like this that l is equal to psi by i right

so in that terms will remain constant so it
is in henry so in this is given equation number

six right
so actually one more thing i would like to

i would like to tell that certain look ah
actually lambda symbol is like this right

but my habit has become to write lambda like
this so throughout this i have to use this

right so ah over all so there should not be
any [laughter] any symbolic [laughter] symbolic

change or anything so this high actually we
use lambda c this thing as a flux linkages

right so it provide equation six we can write
that lambda is equal to we will actually lambda

is equal to psi right flux linkages but we
representing it by lambda now right and lambda

and psi are the r m s values of the flux linkages
and current respectively these are the r m

s values and this is equation seven right
so making use of amperes law if you that is

that making use of amperes law which relates
magnetic field intensity h and and to the

current enclosed that is i suffix is enclosed
current i enclosed right and relates magnetic

field intensity is the loop integral this
integral one this is called loop integral

a h into d l is equal to i enclosed right
so that means this is your amperes law that

you know from you know physics right so this
is equation number eight right at the same

time because later this equation will be used
this equation will be used right

now the flux density right that is in weber
per meter square right is given by b is equal

to mu into h that you know right so this is
equation nine where mu is equal to mu zero

in to mu r and mu zero is equal to four pi
into ten to the power minus seven henry per

meter is the permeability of the free space
and mu r is the relative permeability right

so what we will can do it so replacing d d
by d t in equation four that means this equation

this equation four that means this equation
right you replace d by d t right by j omega

and psi instead of psi i said psi and lambda
both are same you take so right so in that

case that in equation four if you replace
d by d t by j omega the steady state a c voltage

drop due to alternating flux linkages can
be obtained as that v is equal to j omega

l i that is j omega lambda lambda is equal
to l i right

psi is equal to lambda lambda is equal to
l i so this voltage drop in v j omega l i

so j omega l is nothing but that your reactance
you know you can i is the r m s value of the

current so that means j omega and l i is equal
to your flux linkage lambda so b is equal

to j omega lambda this is actually equation
ten right now similarly if you want to find

out the mutual inductance between two circuits
it is defined as the flux linkage of one circuit

due to current in the second circuit right
so it is it may be given as ah generally it

is m a that is m two one later we will see
in the further when you will take the ah your

conductor if to find out the inductance of
the ah single phase to a line and other things

conductors inductance where that i will see
that mutual inductance also

so in that case that we can write m two one
is equal to lambda two one upon i one right

that means this is that mutual inducts it
is henry it is ele it is your equation number

eleven is given right so so mutual flux linkage
between two circuits is defined as the flux

linkage of one circuit due to current in the
second circuit right so that means this is

the flux linkage ah this thing due to the
current of the second circuit due to the current

in the so we are what we call ah due to current
in the there what is this between two circuits

is defined as the flux linkages of one circuit
due to the current in the second circuit so

that is flu if the lambda two one upon i one
that is your flux linkage of one circuit due

to the current in the ah second circuit due
to the current into the first circuit that

is first circuit current is i one right
now therefore if you find out this because

of this mutual inductance or it will be the
voltage drop sub voltage drop in circuit two

then due to the current in circuit one is
given by v two is equal to j omega same as

before into m two one i one right so so j
omega we will remain as it is but lambda two

one is equal to m two one into i one volts
is right so this is the voltage drop in the

second circuit so this way we can determine
that mutual inductance but details we will

see later right now inductance of a single
conductor so transmission lines are thats

why every step i have written it here such
that we should not miss anything so transmission

lines are composed of parallel conductors
and can be assumed as infinite long because

if you if you have seen the over a transmission
line we can assume there parallel conductors

right and it can be we we assume that there
infinite long

so in based on that we will develop expressions
for flux linkages of an isolated current carrying

cylindrical conduct so we will assume that
conductors such of cylindrical type right

solid conductors right with return path lying
at infinity that means we will see that ah

what you call isolated curr current carrying
cylindrical conductor and return path is lying

at infinity means this will completed single
ton circuit right based on these assumption

and and magnetic and your what you call ah
and magnetic flux lines are concentric enclosed

cir concentric closed circles with direction
given by the right hand rule i will told you

at the beginning that if this is that if this
is the your vertical thing that conductor

and if you rub the conductor like this and
if this is the direction of the current then

this will be the flux lines right
so with direction given by the right hand

rule so next is i mean next is to calculate
the inductance of a conductor it is a necessary

to consider the flux inside the conductor
as well as the external flux both internal

as well as external both the flux linkages
we have to considered to determine the inductance

of a single conductor right current carrying
conductor now internal flux progressively

links smaller amount of current as we proceed
inwards towards the center of the conductor

for example for example say they this is the
cross sectional view of the conductor right

and it is carrying current so now now when
you proceed and if and we assume that uniform

current density we assume uniform can you
proceed suppose this is the center from this

center from this surface actually if you move
towards the center right then what we will

happen it progressive links as smaller amount
of current because we are assume in the current

density say it is uniform right
we are assuming that therefore as we move

like this then we that means your internal
flux progress progressively links as much

suppose if you make all internal flux line
all internal i mean i making it like this

suppose you make all intern ah flux line like
this flux line like this like this as you

move from this one towards the centre then
it progressively links smaller amount of current

right so that means as we that means it is
written here as we proceed inwards towards

the centre of the conductor right so an external
flux always link the total current inside

the conductor external flux means ah this
is out ah that is outside the conductor if

this is the conductor then outside the conductor
so it will always link the total current in

the conductor right
so based on this we will try to find out what

will be the internal ah your what you call
that in inductance first so suppose this is

this is your figure one i write and ah this
is your this is your conductor right it is

a long cylindrical conductor and this is the
cross sectional view and its radius is actually

r right and you consider at a distance x right
a small no small your ah infinite a small

that lay in d x this is your d x and this
is the arc lengths is very small one it is

actually d l right and from here that e electric
field intensity at a distance x because from

here it is x here it is x it is a circular
path so from here say you assume that is your

your what you call that electric field it
is your magnetic field intensity is h x right

so this is a cross sectional view of conductor
this is a radius r and at a distance h we

consider small ah very small this thing ah
your with d x right and this is that your

length d l this is the your what we call the
arc length d l right

so in this case what what we will what we
will do that the m m f round a concentric

close circular path of radius x this is a
concentric closed circular path of radius

x right ah internal to the co conductor as
shown in figure one so this is your figure

one this is figure one right and therefore
the loop integral you can write in that h

x into d l is equal to i x suppose at a distance
ah x the current is say i x right this why

you defined and then where h x is equal to
magnetic field intensity that is ampere transfer

meter at a distance x meter from the center
of the conductor so here also it is x here

also it is here also it is x right that the
distance x from the center of the conductor

right and i x is equal to current enclosed
up to distance x so i x is equal to ah current

enclosed up to this distance x right is a
ampere right

since the field field is symmetrical as the
field is totally symmetrical that the h x

h x is constant that every point right so
h x is constant for all points equidis equidistant

from the centre so field is symmetrical so
it is a circular path so everywhere h x we

will remain constant so if it is so then h
x if h x remain constant then this this d

l integration of this d l actually it will
be the total circumference that will be your

two pi x right that is your two pi x and h
x is constant everywhere so into h x this

integral actually is equal to in h x is constant
that everywhere so h x will remain as it is

and d l it is circuit this is the total arc
length but you can if you take the total circumference

integral of that loop integral then it will
be two pi x into h x is equal to this current

your what you call is equal to i x right so
there this is equation fourteen

now so we will we will neglect skin effect
we will neglect this and assuming uniform

current density that means at that if you
take the cross section we will take the uniform

current density right so at a distance at
a distance x i just hold on at a at a distance

x right so this this area of this pi x square
and at a distance r area of the circle is

pi r square so at a distance x current is
i x so current we will assume that current

density is uniform therefore i x upon pi x
square is equal to i upon pi r square right

therefore i x is equal pi pi will be cancel
on both side i x is equal to x square upon

x square into i this is equation fifteen right
so after this from equation fourteen and fifteen

we obtain so in equation fourteen here it
is so equation fourteen right in equation

fourteen you substitute i x is equal to this
one and ah small simply this h x will become

that i upon two pi r square into x ampere
ton per meter right

so this is equation sixteen so for a nonmagnetic
conductor with constant permeability mu zero

the magnetic flux density b x at a distance
x from the centre is right therefore again

again the again the for a look non magnetic
conductor with constant permeability new zero

right so at a distance x what will be my b
x there flux density right so in this case

what you can do is that d x is equal to actually
b x is equal to your new zero into h x and

h x is equal to i upon h x is equal to two
i upon two pi as square into x so new zero

into i upon two pi r square into x right so
this is equation seventeen right so i mu zero

is the permeability of the free space or air
right and is equal to four pi into ten to

the power minus seven henry per meter so now
the differential flux d phi x for a small

region of thickness d x that means this one
this diagram again right

so differential flux d x for a small region
of thickness this this is thickness is d x

this is d x right and one meter length of
the conductor is so the small difference is

d x d phi x is equal to b x into d x into
and it is something like this i hope you will

be able suppose you fold it suppose this is
a this is your conductor this is a conductor

suppose this is this length is this length
is one meter and you have this thickness is

d x right this thickness if you fold it then
this thickness is d x and ah this length is

one meter so area will be this portion d x
into one square meter right i think you have

got it so that means ah ah that means that
d phi x is equal to b x that is a flux density

up a meter square into this area d x into
one right

so thats why the differential flux d phi x
for a small reason of thickness d x and one

meter length your considering of the conductress
d phi x is equal to b x into d x into one

that is b x is equal to mu zero i upon two
pi a square into x right into your what you

call d x so this is equation eighteen so the
flux d phi x actually links only the fraction

of the conductor because it is at a distance
x right it is at a distance x only so it links

that your fraction of the your conductor right
therefore on the assumption of uniform current

density therefore on the assa we have assume
the current density uniform right only the

fractional turn we call reality this there
is no turn because it is constructional we

have constructor but only the fractional turn
of the total current is linked by the flux

because at a distance the area is at a distance
x area it phi x square and conductor radius

is r so its radius is phi r square so we call
this ratio pi x square upon pi r square pi

r square as a fractional turn of the total
current is linked by this flux right

this way we imagine so in that case then what
we will happen then flux linkage will be this

is the fractional turn so flux linkage will
be a d d lambda x into this is actually fractional

turn right into d phi x right so x square
upon r square pi pi cancel actually x square

upon r square into d phi x so d phi x is equal
to you have seen that mu zero by r they have

d phi x is equal to here it is mu zero i upon
two pi square into x into d x substitute then

you will get the d phi x is equal to mu zero
into i divided by two pi r to the power four

into x cube d x this is equation number nineteen
right now there is the conduct radius is r

so integrate from zero to r right then you
will get the total internal ah flux linkages

so lambda internal is equal to zero to r mu
zero i two pi r to the power four into x cube

d x so you integrate and this will be mu zero
into i upon eight pi weber tons per meter

after integrating right so you will find that
this is the independent of r right there is

no r because it will come know r to the power
four upon four so r to the power four four

we cancel right so this is equation twenty
there is lambda internal actually is equal

to we can ah mu zero is equal to four pi into
ten to the power minus seven henry per meter

square so you substitute here four pi into
ten to the power minus seven divided by eight

pi into i weber tons per meter square right
or lambda internal is equal to half into ten

to the power minus seven into i weber ton
per meter right

so lambda internal this is the flux linkage
per meter therefore inductance internal is

equal to lambda upon i so l internal is equal
to lambda internal upon i is equal to half

into ten to the power minus seven henry per
meter that means this internal induct internal

inductance of a current carrying conductor
alternating ah current carrying conductor

right is half into ten to the power minus
seven henry per meter and it is independent

of the radius or diameter of the conductor
that means whatever may be the diameter of

the conductor right or radius of this thing
radius of the conductor whatever may be radius

or diameter this l internal is always a constant
value that is half into ten to the power minus

seven henry per meter square this is i have
marked one equation number twenty one

so that is that ah that is the internal inductance
of a current carrying conductor conductor

half into ten to the minus minus seven right
next one is that inductance due to external

flux linkage so this is the cross sectional
view of the conductors right so ah what we

have taken we have taken to this radius of
this conductor is r we have we have taken

two external point one is at p that is from
the centre of the conductor the distance is

d one this ah this from the center of the
conductor to this point p distance is d one

and another point we have taken q and the
distance is d two right and we have taken

this ah this thing right d two and these two
points are external these are the flux line

we have taken right so now so that this is
figure two flux linkages between two external

points p q write p and q so thats why we have
written here figure two shows two points p

and q at distances d one and d two from a
conductor which carries a current i ampere

so current is carrying by this conductor is
i right since the magnetic lines of flux are

concentric circle this all this line concentric
circle surround this say your around the conductor

whole of the flux between points p and q right
within the concentric cylinder surfaces right

which pass through the pass through this points
right so all are concentric i didnt between

this point is taken q here p here so in between
p and q q point whatever the flux lines there

concentric right so the field intensity at
a distance x right so we have taken at its

some distance x external to the conductor
upon this x is external to the conductor so

the field intensity at a distance x can be
given as h x is equal to i upon two pi x we

have seen that any point this magnetic field
intensity h x we will remain constant because

is a concentric circle right and and at a
distance x the circumference is two pi x

so i is equal to an conductor is carrying
current i so h x is equal to i upon two pi

x is equal to ampere transfer meter wherever
possible i have given the your units right

this is equation twenty two now and the flux
density just you have seen at a distance x

b x is equal to mu zero into h x so mu zero
h x is i upon two pi x this is weber per meter

square this is equation this is equation twenty
three right so the flux outside the conductors

linked the entire current i you are the beginning
i told right and hence the flux linkage d

lambda x is numerically equal to the flux
d phi x here no question of fractional turn

will come because it is external to the conductor
so numerically d lambda x and differential

flux d phi x both are same right
therefore the flux d phi x for a small region

of thickness d x that small region of thickness
d x the flux differential flux d phi x here

right and and we consider one meter length
of the co conductor its given by d lambda

x is equal to d phi x both are same is equal
to b x into d x into one because same same

concept of this area right this is your if
you imagine like this this cylinder this thickness

is d x and this length is one meter and this
thickness is d x right then if you fold it

then this thickness in this one d x into one
the cross sectional area right so in this

case same as be for d lambda x is equal to
d phi x is equal to b x into d x into one

is equal to you substitute b x again mu zero
i upon two pi x d x this is weber per weber

per meter right so this is equation twenty
four therefore the total flux linkage of the

conductor due to flux between points p and
q you have to obtain

so distance of point p from the center of
the conductor is d one and point q is d two

so what we have to do is you have to integrate
this right that means lambda t q right between

this two point integration limit is d one
to d two mu zero into i upon two pi x into

d x is equal to mu zero i upon two pi and
if you int if you ah integrate it this will

be natural law l n d two upon d r d one right
this is equation twenty five right therefore

the inductance between two points that is
p and q external to the conductor is then

given by ah l external is equal to lambda
p q upon i so lambda p q is this much divided

by i means this i this i will be cancel so
it will be mu zero upon two pi natural law

l n d two upon the d one henry per meter right
and if you substitute mu zero is equal to

four pi into ten to the power minus seven
henry per meter if you substitute mu zero

then two pi two pi will be cancel right
ah so ultimately it will be l x ah your it

will be four pi ah divided by four pi into
twenty to the power seven divided by two pi

that means l external be two into ten to the
power minus seven l n d to upon d one henry

per meter this is your equation twenty six
right so that means what is in this case we

can see that l external case it depends on
that your what we call later we will see that

from centre of the ah conductor to some distance
d how things will happen but if you have two

points d one and d two right so you will external
is function of this your both the distance

d one and d two right so it is dependent on
their distance d one and d two later we will

see how ah we will ah simplify further right
so next one is that inductance of a single

phase two wire line right for example before
this thing that suppose you have taken that

your single phase two wire lines right
so this is one conductor that red red one

this is another conductor we assume its radius
is r one is radius is r two it is it is your

current i one and plus means the current entering
into the page of the conductor right thats

why plus thing is given this is return path
dot is showing that means current living the

page right and distance between these two
conductor ah is d right so this is single

phase two wire system so one is carrying your
current i one that is going living into this

and this is return path actually right and
we have to find out that inductance of a single

phase two wire line
