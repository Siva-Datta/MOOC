therefore ah the plant factor is that plant
factor is equal to actual energy produced

divided by maximum plant rating into t this
is t is that that specify time t so this is

equation three plant factor is mostly used
in geneti[cs]- ah ah in generation studies

it is also given as annual plant factor is
equal to actual energy generation by maximum

plant rating right or annual plant factor
that actual annual energy generation or maximum

plant rating into eight seven six zero in
a year total number of hours is eight seven

six zero so three way it can be defined one
is actual energy generation by maximum plant

rating or actual annual energy generation
by maximum plant ah by maximum plant rating

into eight seven six zero so this is your
equation five next is that your diversity

factor
so it is the ratio of the sum of the individual

maximum demand of the various sub divisions
or groups or consumers to the maximum demand

of the whole system right so what is this
it is ratio of sum of individual maximum demands

of the various subdivisions or groups or consumers
to the maximum demand of the whole system

for example diversity at loop diversity factor
we are using system fd because demand factor

we have used either df so thats why i have
made fd so there should not be any confusion

right so diversity factor we term it as fd
is given as fd is equal to sum of individual

maximum demand by coincident maximum demand

or we can write suppose individual maximum
demand say if p one p two p three like this

if they are the maximum demand for individual
ah consumers right so diversity factor fd

is equal to sum i is equal to one to n right
pi divided by pc pi is the maximum demand

of load i right divide and pc is equal to
coincident maximum demand of group of n loads

so this is equation seven so diversity factory
we will use the term fd not df because demand

factor df earlier we have used right so this
is actually your diversity factor hm next

is so these are und understandable right you
have n a n n your n number of consumers and

for each one you will take suppose you have
n is equal to three so here it should be p

one p two for example it is like this suppose
you have ah suppose suppose you have here

n is equal to three then diversity factor
fd will be p one plus p two we will take example

later on p three divided by your pc right
so p one p two p three they are individual

maximum demand of your what you call that
each each type of consumers divided by the

coincidence maximum demand that is pc right
so p one p two p three is the individual maximum

demand right
so next is the diversity factor can be equal

or greater than unity right so from equation
one the demand factor is df is equal to maximum

this is from equation one we are writing demand
factor is equal to maximum demand upon total

connected load therefore maximum demand is
equal to total connected load into diversity

factor a demand factor

so maximum demand is equal to df total connected
load into df this is equation eight right

now for ith consumer for ith consumer let
us assume total connected load is equal to

tcpi right and total connected load tcpi and
demand factor dfi this is for ith consumer

right let us assume this therefore equation
eight can be written as pi is equal to tcpi

into dfi this is equation nine so maximum
demand what p one p two p three i was telling

just now right suppose for i th consumer it
is pi and total and total connected load total

connected load for ith consumer we define
tcpi so t is total connected load at tcpi

into for the ith consumer the demand factor
we can put dfi this is equation nine right

so from equation seven and nine you will get
that your diversity factor fd is equal to

sigma i one to n tcpi into dfi upon pc this
is equation this is equation ah seven this

is equation seven and here you are substitute
this thing this one you are replacing by your

your pi is equal to tcpi into dfi soin this
equation you are substituting pi is equal

to tcpi into dfi right divided by that pc
so this is equation ten so that is your diversity

factor fd df is demand factor but fd is the
diversity factor next one is the coincidence

factor coincidence factor it is the ratio
of the maximum coincident total demand of

a group of consumers to the sum of the maximum
power demands of individual consumers comprising

the group both taken at the same point of
supply for the same time later i will take

few example after that you will see this things
are quite easy yeah it is the ratio of the

maximum coincidence total demand of a group
of consumers of a group of consumers different

type of consumers maybe commercial industrial
agricultural like this right to the sum of

the maximum power demands of individual consumers
comprising the group both taken at the same

point of supply for the same time right that
means the coincidence factor you define it

is by cf is cf is equal to coincidence maximum
demand divided by sum of individual maximum

demand so this is equation eleven

so coincidence maximum demand already defined
pc is the coincidence maximum demand previously

we have defined pc divided by sum of individual
maximum demand this also we have defined right

so cf is equal to pc divided sigma i is equal
to one to n it just just reciprocal of the

your diversity factor right because diversity
factor sum sigma pi your i is equal to one

to n and divided by pc and coincidence factor
is just opposite pc divided by sigma i is

equal to one to n pi this this equation is
number is twelve right that means if you if

you see equation seven just hold on before
this if you if you see equation seven here

equations that diversity factor fd is equal
to sigma i is equal to one to n pi upon pc

seven and this coincidence factor is equal
to just just a reciprocal of it pc divided

by sigma i is equal to one to n pi this is
seven this is equation twelve fd is equal

to one one upon cf or fd into cf is equal
to one right that means 

that means from equation just now i told from
equation twelve and seven we get cf is equal

to one upon fd this is equation thirteen right
does the a coincidence factor is the reciprocal

of the diversity factor or diversity factor
is the reciprocal of the coincidence factor

right
now load diversity so it is the difference

between the sum of the peaks of two or more
individual loads and the peak of the combined

load right therefore load diversity is defined
as ld you are defining load diversity you

define it by ld is equal to sigma i is equal
to one to n pi minus pc this is equation fourteen

it is the difference between the sum of the
peaks of two or more individual loads suppose

you have three different type of loads are
there so their peak you are adding so i is

equal to one to n pi right or and the peak
of the combined your what you call minus the

peak of the combined load that is pc you have
defined earlier right so that is your load

diversity ld is equal to this one minus pc
this is equation fourteen right

so this is your load diversity 
now next is contribution factor it is given

in per unit of the individual maximum demand
of the ith load if ci is the contribution

factor of the i th load to the group of maximum
demand that is ci means suppose ah suppose

your ah it is a given given in per unit of
the individual maximum demand suppose a suppose

power is hundred kilo watt and ci is that
fraction of it

so maybe point four so point four is hundred
forty kilo watt something like this right

so if the ci is the contribution factor of
the ith load to the group of maximum demand

then pc is equal to c one into p one plus
c two into p two up to cn into pn that means

pc is equal to i is equal to one to n ci pi
if this equation number is fifteen right so

from equation twelve and fifteen you will
get equation twelve mean this equation just

hold on so this is equation this is equation
twelve pc upon ah your sigma i is equal to

one to n pi so pc here is i is equal to one
to n ci pi therefore cf is equal to we are

we are substituting pc here a from equation
twelve and fifteen i is equal to n to ci pi

divided by i is equal to one to n pi right
so this is actually equation sixteen this

is your this is cause your one one thing just
there should not be any confusion just one

hold on that just one minute i put this one
this contribution factor right so anyway so

this is your cf is equal to this one this
is equation sixteen right

now consider consider case one if say if p
one is equal to p two is equal to p three

up to pn is equal to p say all are equal right
then cf is equal to your basically all are

all are p p one is equal to p three all are
p then it will basically p into i is equal

to one to n ci right p p will be canceled
here also all are p sum of p so it will be

p into n because it is p plus p plus p up
to nth term so it will be n into p pp will

be cancelled so cf will be sigma i is equal
to one to n ci right the coincidence factor

in this case is equal to the average contribution
factors so average means sum all divided by

n so this is average contribution factor right
similarly case two if c one is equal to c

two is equal to c three cn up to up to say
is equal to c all are c all are same contribution

factor in this case cf will be c into sigma
i is equal to one to n pi upon i is equal

to one to n pi right so is equal to this this
term this term will be cancelled so cf will

be is equal to c that that is coincidence
factor is equal to the contribution factor

right so so so still now we have seen so many
terminology right next is load factor actually

first to have to see all these we have to
familiar with all sort of terminology then

if you take example i will take few examples
right then things will be your ah you know

much clear so thats why before putting an
example in between first we have taken this

all this ah terminology right next load factor
so it is the ratio of the average load over

a designated period of time to the peak load
occurring on that period right therefore load

factor we are defining by lf so load factor
is equal to your average load by peak load

right so this is equation nineteen or load
factor will define average load into t divided

by peak load into t just a your this way also
we can define or load factor is equal to this

term energy served divided by peak load into
t this is equation twenty either average load

by peak load or load factor is equal to energy
served divided by peak load into t this is

equation twenty t is equal to time it may
be in days maybe weeks months or years or

if t is large load factor is small right for
a large t generally you will find that load

factor is small the reason for this is that
for the same maximum demand the energy consumption

cover a larger time period and results in
a smaller average load

so load factor is less than or equal to unity
generally less than one right less than one

and annual load factor can be defined as this
annual load factor is equal to total annual

energy divided by annual peak load into eight
seven six zero number of hours in a year is

eight seven six zero so this is equation twenty
one right now another terminology that is

the loss factor right say meaning is same
load factor- only thing is that it is the

ratio of the average power loss to the peak
load power loss during a specified period

of time this is called loss factor right for
example therefore the loss factor is defined

as we defined llf loss factor we defined as
llf is equal to average power loss divided

by power loss at peak load right so this is
equation say twenty two

so equation twenty two is applicable to the
copper loss of the system but not for iron

loss that means loss factor you can compute
is for i square r loss only but not for iron

losses right so only applicable to the i square
r loss next we will take one example for example

so a power station supplies the load as given
bellow say time duration is given for example

say time is hours six am to eight am load
is one point two megawatt eight am to nine

am load is two megawatt nine am to twelve
noon

it is say three megawatt twelve noon to two
pm one point five megawatt and two pm to six

pm two point five megawatt then six pm to
eight pm one point eight megawatt eight pm

to nine pm it is two megawatt nine pm to eleven
pm it is one megawatt eleven pm to five am

it is point five megawatt and five am to six
am it is point eight megawatt this data are

given a power station as given below so that
means twenty four hours data that load variations

are given to you right so what you have to
do is you have to you have to first deter[mine]-

first thing plot the load curve and find out
the load factor next is determine the proper

number and size of generating units to supply
this load c is find the reserve capacity of

the plant and plant factor and d is find out
the operating schedule of the generating units

selected so this four thing you have to determine
based on the given data solve sense first

what you do you draw the load curve forget
about this line it is up to this only you

think right so first is six ten six am ten
am this way am are two pm six pm ten pm two

am six am right so at six am at six am ah
six am to eight am load is one point two megawatt

so at six am it is one point two so it will
come up to your two your six to eight am

some are here so have to your it is one point
two megawatt now eight am to nine am two megawatt

so here it has gone to two megawatt and it
is eight to nine just one hour right and again

nine am to twelve noon the peak nine am to
twelve noon if it is going to peak it is three

megawatt right and then the twelve noon to
two pm one your ah nine am to twelve noon

it is your ah this thing twelve noon is here
somewhere here is twelve noon it is three

megawatt then twelve noon to two pm one point
at twelve noon again it is going down to one

point five somewhere here right and it is
upto two pm here right again two pm to six

pm two point five so at two pm again it is
going to two point five to six pm means up

to this two point five megawatt then six pm
to eight pm one point zero so it is coming

down to six pm one point zero up to six it
is going after that coming down right one

point zero eight zero rather one point eight
zero to eight pm somewhere here then eight

pm to nine one hour it is two megawatt it
is two megawatt and nine pm to eleven am one

megawatt
so at nine it is coming down nine to eleven

it is one megawatt right and then eleven pm
to five am this is eleven pm somewhere here

to five am up to this it is point five megawatt
here it is a point five megawatt and five

am to six am point eight zero megawatt so
for five am it is going to point eight then

for six am point eight is ok but again it
will you have to you have to come here again

it is six am is coming so finally one point
two megawatt this is also this point is also

one point two megawatt so this way you should
complete this your what you call that your

load curve this is this is called your you
plot the load curve first right

so once this load curve is plotted this is
a time and this is the ah your what you call

megawatt load and peak is of course the your
ah three megawatt right once you compute that

load curve then the units generated during
twenty four hours right so again again what

will do that first you calculate units generated
in twenty four hours so in that case ah that

if you see here just side by side i am trying
to put right so six am to eight am one point

two megawatt and six to eight mean two hours
so two into one point two plus two megawatt

load but eight to nine only one hours so one
into two plus that nine am to twelve am twelve

noon so that means three hours and three megawatt
load so plus three into three plus this twelve

noon to two pm that means two hours right
so two into one point five load is one point

five megawatt plus two pm to six pm that means
four hours load is two point five so four

into two point five then plus six pm to eight
pm mean two hours into one point eight load

is one point eight megawatt plus eight pm
to nine that is one hour one into two megawatt

load into two then plus nine pm to eleven
that means two hours load is one megawatt

so two into one plus your eleven pm to five
am that means six hours in load is point five

megawatt so six into point five plus five
am to six am that will one hour load is point

eight so into point eight this much of megawatt
hour this way you should compute that unit

is generated during twenty four hours right
once once you have done this that is is equal

to total unit generate is thirty after ah
calculating all this it is thirty seven point

eight megawatt hour right now average load
is just we have seen know load factor units

generated by time in hours so units generated
is thirty seven point eight megawatt hour

and divided by twenty four because duration
duration duration from six to six six am to

six am is twenty four hours

so it is your ah twenty four hours so that
is one point five seven five megawatt that

is the average load right and load factor
is equal to lf is equal to average load by

maximum load so maximum load is ah three megawatt
maximum is three megawatt so have load factor

is equal to one point five seven five upon
three that is is equal to point five two five

that is so this is a load factor now next
is that maximum demand next point b just b

is that you have to determine the proper number
and size of generating units to supply this

load listen we are not doing here any economics
we are not trying to optimize anything just

just to have some ideas so this point is given
determine the proper number and size of generating

units to supply this load so from our intuition
we will try to make it but any not considering

any cost benefit analysis or anything just
just through give us a idea right so b number

b is that second point is you have to determine
the proper number and size of generating units

to supply this load right

so in this case in this case that maximum
demand is three megawatt right and that means

you have to supply power this three megawatts
of power therefore if we choose four generating

units of rating one megawatt each may be selected
suppose we are taking four generating units

and each one is having is rating is one megawatt
say right therefore during that period of

maximum demand three units can operate it
can operate will operate and it will attached

to operate at its full load because one megawatt
rating and one unit will remain as standby

by chance if one unit goes off another unit
may be switched on right so from the reliability

purpose one one four generating units is considered
if you consider three megawatt and three units

that is fine as long as it will generate there
is no loss of generation but if one generator

becomes faulty then it cannot supply the load
thats why one extra is taken right

so four is taken so three units will operate
and one unit will remain as standby right

next one is next next point is given find
the reserve capacity of the plant and plant

factor right so in that case plant capacity
is equal to four into one because we have

taken we have considered four generating units
each one one megawatt so it is four into one

so four megawatt and reserve capacity will
be then maximum demand is three megawatt so

reserve capacity will be four minus three
is equal to one megawatt right now from equation

three the plant factor is equal to actual
energy produced divided by maximum plant rating

into t now actual energy this is from equation
three right so actual energy actual energy

produced is equal to thirty seven point eight
megawatt hour just now we have seen thirty

seven point eight megawatt hour right and
make and the plant max plant capacity now

four megawatt so maximum plant rating will
be four megawatt so time duration is twenty

four hours therefore plant factor is equal
to thirty seven point eight divided by maximum

plant rating is four megawatt so it is four
four four and number of hours is t is equal

to twenty four time duration twenty four hours
because six am to six am interval so it is

coming around point three nine three seven
five

for example if you are chosen if you are chosen
instead of four five ah your five generating

units right in that case plant capacity should
have been five megawatt then reserve capacity

should have been five minus three say two
megawatt right

so in that case this thirty seven point eight
zero divided five into twenty four that means

this plant factor ah will shall be less than
this one right so but anyway so this is your

what you call plant factor ah is point three
nine three seven five and last one this number

d last one that find out the operating schedule
of the generating units selected right you

have to find out how these units will operate
so in that case what one can do is if you

see of your own that ah that ah one generating
unit of one megawatt must work for twenty

four hours because they have no where lord
is zero minimum is point eight if you look

at that data ah if you look at data that we
are sorry minimum is point five megawatt sorry

point five megawatt so that means this one
generator has to be on for twenty four hours

because this point five megawatt load has
to be supplied because minimum is point minimum

load is point five megawatt right and then
second generating unit of one megawatt ah

requires six am to nine pm that fifteen hours
if you look carefully at least six am to nine

pm you can observe that load is more than
one megawatt

thats why two units required if you look at
that your six am to nine pm say six am if

you look at that every higher one point two
two three all these things going on till two

pm right ah six am to nine pm rather up to
this you say that it is more than two right

two ah or it is more your what you call ah
six am to ah nine am fifteen hours second

generating unit of one megawatt is required
because all the time load is two so this two

unit is also required but if you see third
generating unit one megawatt nine am to twelve

noon and two pm to six pm seven hours required
that means it is overlapping so this nine

am to twelve noon and two pm to six pm for
this seven hours you need all the three units

should be on right so that means for one megawatt
one unit for twenty four hours then another

generating units must be on six am to nine
pm for fifteen hours and third unit nine am

to twelve noon as well as two pm to six pm
seven hours because the load will be during

this duration it will be more than two megawatt
right so this way from your intuition from

your common sense you can find out how this
generator operating schedule can be ah can

be desired made right so from the data and
from whatever we have made it here you can

have a look and just see this is this is the
way that things can be i mean operating schedule

can be prepared
